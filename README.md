# The Game Of Life (C++, TDD)

This is a C++ adaptation of the ever
popular [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

The benefit of this implementation is how it can be beneficial for understanding how to implement the game in a clean and well tested way.

The tests are also pretty helpful for learning how to code up the game.
